This folder contains the python files (python 2.7) of the 5 algorithms
and a folder named puzzles which contains the text files of the input 
sudoku problems.

Run the python files in python 2.7

Run the python files individually as:
python <filename>

After running any file, you will be asked to choose if you want to run
the algorithm on existing input problem or any other test case.
